      <h1>DOCUMENTATION</h1>
        <h3>HTML/CSS Validation</h3>
            <p>My HTML pages validated. However, it is to be noted that there is a general warning that the validator flagged:

                <blockquote>
                    Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.
                </blockquote>

            which is actually a decision I made due to aesthetic reasonings. I don't want to have headers everywhere in my page but I still wanted to divide my page up into sections.</p>

            <p>
                The validator complained about my moz-box-shadow and moz-border-radius, as well as the webkit-box-radius and webkit-box-shadow commands, stating that they're not supported.
            </p>

        <h3>Speed of Pages</h3>
            <p>The site took about 1.5seconds to load. The most image intensive page which contains my portfolio took 2.2seconds to load. As I had used images that I had first edited on Photoshop instead of loading full resolution images, the site didn't take too long to load.
            </p>

        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
            <p>There is a degree of flexibility and responsiveness of my site. This is due to the fact that I used the floating layout which usually works well enough for mobile devices. The maximum width of my site is also placed at a comfortable 800px which will fit most screens well enough. </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>According to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, I probably need to adjust some of the font sizes. At the moment, most of my fonts are at an automatic weight and size, but as I am using some Google Fonts, that could mean that some of the fonts may be too small for some users. That said, I did provide alternative font types along with the ones that I have specified to overcome that issue.</p>

        <h3>Browser Independence</h3>
            <p>I tested the site on Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. In all the different browsers, the site works the way I had expected. In Firefox, the colors are a little more muted. When the Java Script was turned off, the site still works just fine as the only thing that was really affected was the slideshow.</p>

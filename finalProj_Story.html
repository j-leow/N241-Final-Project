                <p>I am an individual whom many would say is passionate about a diverse array of subjects ranging from computer science, mathematics, art, interior design, architecture, martial arts, writing and mental health awareness.</p>

                <p>I consider myself a creative developer - someone who merges aesthetically creative designs with solid programming work. I really combining the creativity of the arts, and the technicality of the sciences. </p>

                <p>On the more artistic and creative side, from 2012-2016, I digitally inked comic pages and characters while supporting J.S. Skye LLC as a Managing Partner. Presently, I am continuing to work on improving my skills in calligraphy and drawing with ink.</p>

                <p>Informed by my background as a graduate in the linguistics field and my experience as a Lecturer while in Malaysia, I am always actively engaging and interacting with new people. I am not afraid to reach out to new contacts and make connections. I've been told that I have a strong personality and great interpersonal skills.</p>

                <p>As a self-proclaimed geek-nerd, things like <quote>Stargate SG1</quote>, <quote>Star Trek</quote>. <quote>Star Wars</quote>, <quote>Firefly</quote>, <quote>Harry Potter</quote>, and many other movies, books, games, and comics keep me sane on more mundane days.</p>

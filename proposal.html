      <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <h3>What is the topic of your project?</h3>
            <p>I want to create a portfolio website for my career as a student, and to showcase the skills that I have to offer.</p>

        <h3>Why did you choose this topic?</h3>
            <p>I feel that this is a pertinent topic for me since I'm getting to a point where I'd like to get internships, as well as part time jobs. I want to show my skills to potential employers.</p>

        <h3>What background knowledge do you bring to this topic?</h3>
            <p>I used to own a portofolio website a couple of years ago when I was showcasing my skills as a calligraphy artist, and though I didn't know any CSS or HTML then, I am familiar with the kind of look and feel a site like that should have. I am also an expert in myself, so I would not run out of information or knowledge to put on the site.</p>

        <h3>Who is your intended audience?</h3>
            <p>I would like for potential employers, as well as my professors to see my website. This will highlight my skills to them.</p>

    <h1>Timeline</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately I don't have a clear idea for a timeline yet.</p>
